					Realmplex may be going through a second Chaos Day today. And this
					time, it&apos;s worse.
					<br />
					<br />
					Right now, Realmplex is &quot;being held hostage&quot; by server host
					SandwichPress, who had been banned earlier today for duping railway
					tracks and carpets. This occurred amidst growing arguments over
					SpecShark, the current admin, introducing a full ban on slurs; this
					rule has since been backtracked. TaylorWorld says he may remove the
					realmplex.com domain, saying that he does not want SandwichPress using
					it; he has lost access to the server amidst the situation. There is no
					word from Kiddorox as far as we are concerned.
					<br />
					<br />
					PMI understands there have been negotiations between the two sides.
					They have agreed to draft new rules entirely and will discuss this
					tomorrow (10 May 2023).
					<br />
					<br />
					Follow PMI for further information.

					Four days after the national elections, the vote to choose Bird
					Land&apos;s representative is now complete.
					<br />
					<br />
					There were three candidates, JVTA of the Potato Democrats,
					TheAllSeeingBird of The Opportunities Party, and Dumb_Catz, an
					independent candidate.
					<br />
					<br />
					Five votes were received this election.

					The results showed a clear consensus between Bird Land residents about
					reelecting the former monarch of Bird Land, TheAllSeeingBird, who
					originally intended to run as a Potato Democrats candidate, but just
					as quick as he returned to the political scene, he left the PD for a
					second time and instead created The Opportunities Party.
					<br />
					<br />
					With a result now achieved, parliament now sits at two seats for both
					Potato Democrats and the United Crop Party, and one seat for The
					Opportunities Party. Because no party has a majority, and the fact
					that the two largest parties are tied, a coalition must be formed.

					Today&apos;s elections in the Sea Spray Islands have concluded.
					<br />
					<br />
					The SSI Herald states that the Union Party, run by incumbent head of
					state McTwoPoint0, has won an absolute majority in the vote, receiving
					100% of the vote. On the flip side, the SSI Democrats party, led by
					journalist TheAllSeeingBird, received no votes.
					<br />
					<br />
					This landslide can be attributed to the Sea Spray Islands&apos;
					election rules, which state that no politicians are allowed to vote.
					Henceforth, there were only four eligible voters.
					<br />
					<br />
					TheAllSeeingBird has conceded the election and congratulated
					McTwoPoint0 in an article published by the Realmplex News Network. The
					next election&apos;s dates are yet to be confirmed.
